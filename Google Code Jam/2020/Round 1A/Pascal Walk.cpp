/*
Notice that the entries in the r-th row (counting starting from 1) sum to 2^r-1
=> We can represent N in binary, and then look through that representation, starting from the least significant bit
=> If the r-th least significant bit (counting starting from 1) is a 1,
   our path should consume all of the elements in the r-th row
=> However, as the path must be continuous, we may overshoot as we traveling from rows to rows, so instead of N we can
   we can find the path to reach N - 30 (as we 2^30 > 10^9) and then we can always balance back by traveling through "1" cell
